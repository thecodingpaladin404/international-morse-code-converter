# International morse code converter

This program will take something you type in and convert it to international morse code.

Made with the help of [@Bookie0](https://repl.it/@Bookie0) and [@Coder100](https://repl.it/@Coder100) on [repl.it](https://repl.it/talk/share/International-Morse-Code-Converter/46577).

There is currently a bug with spaces, so don't add any.

Also working on a thing that will convert morse code to english.
